    <p>Korean Barbecue-Style Meatballs – Mushy is Not Tender</p>
    <p>
      When it comes to cooking, there is no better teacher than a tragic
      failure, which is how I learned not to use too much raw ginger in a
      marinade for meat. I don't remember exactly when I became aware of this
      issue, but it was a long time ago, and probably involved watching pieces
      of meat mysteriously fall apart into mushy shards that slip through the
      grates of the grill to a fiery, disappointing death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that's what happens if you add too much raw ginger to meat, and let
      it sit around before cooking it. It's a lesson you never forget. Until you
      do. As usual, I'll blame the 'fog of war' that happens during a video
      shoot, but it never occurred to me that the piece of ginger I was mincing
      was going to cause trouble. And, it would've caused much more trouble had
      I not been in such a hurry. I was going to let the mixture sit in the
      fridge for hours, and if I had, I'm not sure what I would've ended up
      eating for dinner, but it would not have been Korean barbecue-style
      meatballs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll let you Google precisely why/how the enzymes in ginger dissolve
      protein, and I already explained in the video how to avoid this issue by
      deactivating the ginger with heat or acid, so I won't go over that again
      now. Instead, I will finish up by bragging about how delicious these were.
      They're very sweet and spicy, and little salty, but also profoundly savory
      and satisfying. When served over plain rice to absorb all the big flavors,
      these makes for a truly incredible meal, which is why I really do hope you
      give it a try soon. Enjoy!

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>
        2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger (heated to 150 F degrees (65 degrees C)
        to deactivate enzymes, or soaked in 1 tablespoon vinegar for 5 minutes)
      </li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup thinly sliced green onions, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>½ cup finely crushed buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®)</li>
      <li>toasted sesame seeds for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add ground beef to a bowl and spread gochujang evenly over the surface
        of the meat. Season evenly with kosher salt, pepper, and soy sauce.
        Spreading out the seasoning will reduce the time you need to handle the
        meat. Spread fresh ginger and garlic evenly over the surface. Add green
        onions and cracker crumbs. Mix in quickly with a fork until well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>Cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees C (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Form mixture into 12 equal-sized balls using wet hands. Add to a cast
        iron skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until nicely browned, about 20
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer meatballs to a plate while preparing the sauce in the same
        skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain most of the grease but 1 teaspoon out of the skillet and set onto
        stove over medium-high heat. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1
        minute. Deglaze skillet with rice vinegar and soy sauce. Stir in brown
        sugar, beef broth, and gochujang. Season with sesame oil and Sriracha.
        Stir sauce and bring to a simmer. Cook until reduced by a third.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile stir together cornstarch and water in a small bowl to create a
        slurry. Reduce heat to medium-low and mix in slurry while whisking
        constantly. Keep simmering sauce until it has reduced to about half. Add
        meatballs back into the skillet and baste with the sauce. Allow to
        simmer, basting generously, until meatballs are heated through and are
        well soaked with sauce, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve garnished with toasted sesame seeds and green onions.</li>
    </ol>
